> Welcome to 2024 üê≥

This is the first time I've decided to write a year review. Perhaps the main reason is so that I can read these lines again years later and nostalgically be amazed and content with what I used to be.

## What happened
Many things have happened in the last year. I learned a lot about what works and what doesn't. Some highlights include:

- **Having a full-time internship at Whydah in the summer**. Actually, I didn't expect this. Thanks to many great people, I successfully seized the opportunity. Who could think that suddenly I'm in Ho Chi Minh City, living a weird different life for 3 months? To summarize, I had a great time there meeting and working with incredible people. I had the chance to join a running club (shout out to RRC), participate in Cu Chi City Trail, run for 10 km, and then immediately ended up in the hospital, staying for the next 7 days because of bacterial pneumonia (thought I was dying btw, that period was worse than these words can describe) ü´†. I bet nobody could have this kind of experience. Anyway, thanks to everybody at Whydah and those precious memories. Hope we can meet again.
- **ICPC**: Besides visiting Hue City for the Regional and managing to qualify for the upcoming Super Regional, there's not much to talk about. My team and I didn't give the best performance possible. I even failed hard at the ICPC Hue competition too, but I'm still lucky enough üå∏.
- **Others**: In the remaining part of the year, it's just me dealing with some boring university deadlines

## Cool things I found in 2023
- **[Polyphasic sleep](https://www.polyphasic.net/)**: This is basically sleeping in multiple blocks during a day as opposed to sleeping only once. The cool thing is you can sleep a lot less than usual and still function normally (hopefully). I totally recommend everybody to read through the website (even if not doing the polyphasic sleep thing). There's a lot of useful information about sleep, such as sleep stages, REM, and SWS peak... I found out about the method at the start of the summer and decided to give it a try while being in HCM city. As the internship is full-time 9-5, the only suitable schedule is Dual Core. I tested [Dual Core 1](https://www.polyphasic.net/dual-core-1/). ![](/assets/DC1-default-1.png)  It wasn't close to easy, especially for the first few days. I tried this for a few weeks with many days oversleeping or missing the nap. I learned a lot about my body and mind during the experiment anyway. 
Recently, I tried a different schedule, still a Dual Core though. It's a 5-hour sleep at night (3 cycles and a bonus 30 minutes of additional REM), a 1.5-hour nap in the early afternoon, and a short 15-20 minutes nap at any time. It's working really well with my body though.
- **Media**:
    - **[Huberman Lab's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab)**: The most incredible podcast on neuroscience, health, and science-related tools. I learned a lot about sleep, motivation, dopamine, exercise, mental health, meditation... And it's not like some random hustling dude rambling about just doing it, or giving your 100% all the time... It's real science. I also found this useful [site](https://hubermanhub-bullet.pages.dev/) that summarizes all the knowledge, protocols and stuff.
    - **[HealthyGamerGG](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG)**: This one is cool too. It's more on the psychology kind of things. I usually listen to this before falling sleep üò¥.
- **Others**:
    - **[NSDR (Non Sleep Deep Rest)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKGrmY8OSHM)**: This is one of the most famous protocols of the Huberman Lab. Basically, you lie down, listen to the narration, and follow the steps for about 10-20 minutes. You can even fall asleep during it. The benefits are you can rest efficiently in a short amount of time and improve your learning or something (I watched the podcast but forgot).
    - **Anki**: This marks the most active period of using Anki for the last few years. I mainly study English words and random knowledge that I want to remember.
    - **Japanese**: Somehow I tried learning Japanese on Duolingo for a few days and eventually decided to give this a try. I'm still in the very early stages of the language learning process, downloading some Anki decks and studying for a few minutes every day.

- Some other projects I did along the way:
    - Obsidian workflow improving. (Obsidian is a thriving note-taking app btw).
    - [VietCard - A flashcard mobile application](https://github.com/HynDuf/vietcard) for the UI course at university.
    - [Personal Blog Website](https://hynduf.github.io/): I put together this site in the last 3 days of 2023, just for this post to be published üòá.

## Thank you
Turns out, I just wrote a bunch of random recommendations throughout the year without much reflection ü•π. Looking back, there are still ups and downs like every year, but I appreciate all of them for shaping who I am today. Lastly, I'd like to give a huge thanks to my family and friends. Thanks for reading till this last line; I wish you have an incredible and healthy new year in 2024.
